      <p>How is it that these violent and malicious beasts have come to be widely accepted as adorable and plodding? I once saw a herd of turtles devour an elephant from its feet up!

          <li>This site has good color design. The feathered background image is nice as well. While the tabs at the top are useful for segmenting content this site does so very inefficiently. For example if you click on the "water turtles" tab, it pushes all of the home page content past the bottom of the screen.</li>
